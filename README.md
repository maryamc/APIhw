# Weather Dashboard
This is the Weather Dashboard API homework assignment

This webpage uses
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - jQuery
 - Bootstrap
 - API

The function of this application is to provide the user with information about the current weather upon search and to also show the subsequent 5 day forecast
-   This includes:
    - temperature (converted from K to F)
    - humidity
    - wind speed
    - UV index (for those hot summer days so you can put on some sunscreen!)

Upon searching, the information will be stored in local storage and then displayed on the screen under the search bar. Searched items will append onto a list and any of them can be click, and the information will be retrieved.
